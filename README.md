Faculty Skills Database

Faculty Skills Database is the temorary name for this project. A more pemanent solution should be applied later, most likely after closed Beta.

Rollout will follow this timeline:
1. Pre-Alpha stage: the skeleton of the project is built.
2. Alpha stage: Data is imported and more primary functions are added.
3. Closed Beta: Full required functionality implemented, and ready for actual data entry and testing.
4. Open Beta: Opened to the public for all features but denoted as may having some issues.
5. Launched: Most major bugs solved and the application has been robustly tested.

Currently we're in "Alpha Stage" going into "Closed Beta" by the end of August.
